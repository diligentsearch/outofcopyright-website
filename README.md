Diligent Search project
==========

## About

This repository holds the Diligent search project, based on a forked version of the OutOfCopyright project.

*Note*: under development.

Changes from the commit nÂ°b50db09f14b44cfe9b77ad8ebd49b0b9545157c0
 * Rebase of the data model to match the fact that questions can be reused
 * The model will be now splitted into 3 parts : data model creation / graph model / form model
 * Each of these models comes from the precedent and will have impact on the follower based on an ID system

Modals are used to regain flexibility within code writting
